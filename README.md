# Electronics toolkit

This program is more or less a calculator for electronics. It will do most basic calculations in DC and AC along with some electromagnetism. I will be adding more functions as I go along with learning electronics since I'm still a student in the EE shop at my high school. 

I cannot guaruntee that this will be as good as something like SPICE. It is more for my electronics class and for furutre projects.
